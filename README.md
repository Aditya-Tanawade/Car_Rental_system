I have installed java 17 in my system i can see
D:\>java -version
java version "17.0.11" 2024-04-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.11+7-LTS-207)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.11+7-LTS-207, mixed mode, sharing)

But inside my STS and IntelliJ whenever i try to do mvn install or other maven clean i am getting Cannot start maven from wrapper
But this mvn clean / intall works in simple maven projects
Solve this issue
